<p> This is Lofree's mechanical keyboard named "Tofu". It's a beautiful off white/cream color keyboard that comes prebuilt. It has 3 different ways to connect to whatever device you'll be using the keyboard for. These methods include bluetooth, usb, and wifi. What makes this keyboard so unique is the ergonomic shape of the keyboard itself. It was made with the users' wrists in mind. This has been translated into a 9 degree curve which makes typing much easier on the wrists and workload. Additionally, the keyboard is hotswappable which means users can change the switches and the keycaps hassle-free which makes customization more convenient. It also includes Mac AND Windows layout keys so users can switch between the two layouts depending on the device it's connected to or the user's own familiarity with Mac or Windows. </p>

<p> I want this keyboard because the switches don't sound bad, the color can be easily matched with other colors if I wanted to change the keycaps, and the shape of it seems like it would help with my wrist pain. Everything about it seemed like what I had wanted in a keyboard. Additionally, it was a good entry-level cost. Due to the Black Friday discount, it amounted to $105 instead of $140. Because it has 3 different ways to connect to devices, I could use my laptop, ipad, and future deskptop with it. I feel that everything this keyboard has to offer is definitely worth the price and purchase.
