### [Handmade Custom Moroccan Rug](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1193262444/costum-moroccan-colorful-rug-authentic?click_key=31f99ddb23568020f45c1334703eb0c941d7ea61%3A1193262444&click_sum=011d8193&ref=user_profile&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1)

<p> The reason why I want this is because I wanted a rug for my dorm and future apartment. As I get older, I start to want things for my living space more and more. I love the colors in this rug as well as the texture of the fibers. I think this rug has a lot of character and would add a spark of color to any space. I've been wanting to liven up my dorm room too, especially since my cat is here with me and I think he deserves a rug. </p>
