## Item 2
<p> This is the second item I want. Here I'll explain what it is and why I want it. </p>

### [Scenic Illustrated Mousepad](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1279814155/kawaii-green-desk-mat-cute-mousepad?click_key=612dc45817b71752849bc55707915197ef9e8904%3A1279814155&click_sum=7fb83cfe&ref=user_profile&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1)

<p> The reason why I want this is because I wanted to rest my keyboard on top of something to protect the keyboard as well as add flair to my study space. I wanted a large enough mousepad to put both my keyboard and mouse on top of it. It also seems like it would add cushioning underneath my wrists and forearms. The color scheme of the mousepad's design would also go well with the color scheme I want for my setup. </p>
