<p> I want this keyboard because the switches don't sound bad, the color can be easily matched with other colors if I wanted to change the keycaps, and the shape of it seems like it would help with my wrist pain. Everything about it seemed like what I had wanted in a keyboard. Additionally, it was a good entry-level cost. Due to the Black Friday discount, it amounted to $105 instead of $140. Because it has 3 different ways to connect to devices, I could use my laptop, ipad, and future deskptop with it. I feel that everything this keyboard has to offer is definitely worth the price and purchase. </p>
